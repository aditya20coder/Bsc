Loop
Loop  can execute a block of code as long as specified condition is reached 
Loop are handy bcz they save time reduce error an they make code more readbale

While Loop
The while loop through a block of code as long as specified condition is true

while(condition)
{
//block of code
}


do while
the do whle loop is a variant of while loop this loop will execute the code block once before checking if condition is true or not then it will repeat the loop as long as condition is true

int i=0;
do
{
cout<<i<<"\n";
i++
}
while(i<5)
return 0;

For loop
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop a block of code use the for loop instant of while loop
statement 1 is execute 1 time before the execution of code block
           2statement 2 define the condition to executing code block
state 3 is execute every time after the code block has been executed

for(int i=0;i<10;i++)
cout<<i<<"\n";
